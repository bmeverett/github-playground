# github-playground
Welcome to the Playground! This playground is for using Issues, Pull requests, etc. on Github

# About 
I made this to see what it's like having an open source project. Going to experiment with issues and pull requests. Not really sure what kind of project (if any) I'll put here. So feel free to leave an issue or pull request if you're learning to!
